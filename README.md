# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! A Tool where you can see the sorting algorithms **Bubblesort**, **Quicksort** and **Heapsort** in action.
I build this application to get a feel for the role of **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** in web applicatications
while learning about sorting algorithms and the code-implementation of such algorithms. \
You can access it here: https://diasdecastro.github.io/sorting-visualizer/

# Instructions
